# wix-velo-examples

This repo serves as a way to document some of the ways I used Velo in a WiX template to customize the experiences of users on a WiX site. These are examples and will probably need to be adapted to fit specific needs. I hoped to document this for myself so I can use as a resources for client website on WiX.

The backend folder is for code that would be placed in the WiX site backend area. You would need to enable dev mode in the WiX editor to see an option for the backend.

The other folders are based on the elements used to solve various problems.
